Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony counts and size classes, and visual estimation of percent cover. Either 0.5m or 1m on each side of the transect lines were included in the belt (for a total of 50m2 or 100m2 per site), depending on colony density.","layer_slug_s":"cred-rea-coral-population-parameters-at-laysan-island-northwestern-hawaiiian-islands-2004","solr_geom":"ENVELOPE(-171.78032, -171.675474, 25.803717, 25.697471)","dc_subject_sm":["1221","northwestern hawaiian islands","hawaii","coral reef ecology","rapid ecological assessment (rea)","zoology","central pacific","earth science","coastal processes","coral cover","biology","numeric data sets","laysan island","oceans","hii0401","photic zone corals","long-term monitoring of benthos (coral","other invertebrates","algae) - rapid ecological assessments at all u.s. pacific islands","biodiversity","biosphere","coral","coral reefs","corals"]}
