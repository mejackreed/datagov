Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) personnel aboard the ship submitted these data and associated metadata to NODC. In addition, NODC Accession 0124596 contains supplementary cruise-level metadata, which OMAO personnel logged in the Ship Daily Activity Log (SDAL). OMAO and NODC personnel developed the automated process to archive these data under the auspices of the NOAA Rolling Deck to Repository (NOAA R2R) program.","layer_slug_s":"underway-meteorological-navigational-optical-physical-and-time-series-data-collected-aboard-thec6796","solr_geom":"ENVELOPE(-175.2087, -152.0883, 63.6039, 53.8506)","dc_subject_sm":["ocean temperature","atmosphere","chlorophyll","temperature sensors","rmc - recommended minimum navigation information","turbidity","active remote sensing","pacific ocean","hdt - heading - true","noaa","ocean optics","vtg - track made good and ground speed","ocean","doc/noaa/nesdis/ncei","bod - bearing - waypoint to waypoint","salinity","national oceanographic data center","nesdis","noaa","u.s. department of commerce","earth science","anemometers","oceanography","current/wind meters","bering sea","atmospheric pressure","vbw - dual ground/water speed","$gpchl - fluoro-datefluoro-timechloro-countsntu-counts","mm/dd/yy gmtpstcntscnts","wetlabs flntus fluorometer and turbidity sensor","s/n 1166. nmea $gpchl date (gmt). note 04feb2012: date and time from instrument is in pst. previous seasons' data also in local time. changed to gmt 09feb2012 for dy1201. need to look into this and update for 2013 season.wetlabs flntus fluorometer and turbidity sensor","s/n 1166. nmea $gpchl time (gmt). note 04feb2012: date and time from instrument is in pst. previous seasons' data also in local time. changed to gmt 09feb2012 for dy1201. need to look into this and update for 2013 season.wetlabs flntus fluorometer and turbidity sensor","s/n 1166. nmea $gpchl raw chlorophyll counts.wetlabs flntus fluorometer and turbidity sensor","s/n 1166. nmea $gpchl raw turbidity counts. turbidity is inversely correlated with transmission (reflectivity).","wetlabs flntus fluorometer and turbidity sensor","s/n 1166. located in chemlab as part of the scientific seawater system. calibrated november 30","2012.","acoustic velocity","doc/noaa/omao","echo sounders","wind speed/wind direction","pressure/height meters","mtw - mean temperature of water","mwv - wind speed and angle","http://www.omao.noaa.gov","water temperature","atmospheric temperature","rmb - recommended minimum navigation information","did - pitch and roll","passive remote sensing","conductivity","conductivity","temperature","depth","gps","pashr - heave pitch roll message","thermosalinographs","rot - rate of turn","national centers for environmental information","nesdis","noaa","u.s. department of commerce","acoustic sounders","temperature/humidity sensors","noaa's office of marine and aviation operations","noaa","u.s. department of commerce","oceans","water depth","turbidity meters","ocean acoustics","spectrometers/radiometers","surface winds","gll - geographic position - latitude/longitude","oscar dyson","profilers/sounders","earth remote sensing instruments","dpt - depth of water","positioning/navigation","government agencies-u.s. federal agencies","od","doc/noaa/nesdis/nodc","salinity/density","humidity sensors","atmospheric winds","oxygen","fluorometers","doc","gulf of alaska","aerovanes","mta - air temperature the use of $--xdr is recommended.","humidity","ctd","dbs - depth below surface","gga - global positioning system fix data","north pacific ocean","photon/optical detectors","chemical meters/analyzers","bathymetry/seafloor topography","hydrostatic pressure","atmospheric water vapor","barometers","in situ/laboratory instruments","ocean chemistry"]}
